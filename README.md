Car_Monitoring_System Simulation

Smart Entry-Exit Monitoring System Project Description This repository contains a Wokwi simulation of a smart entry-exit monitoring system for a License Renewal Unit, implemented using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system tracks vehicle count using push-button sensors at entrance and exit gates, displaying the current count (0-8) via 8 LEDs.

Key Components Hardware Simulation:

ESP32 microcontroller

2 push buttons (simulating entry/exit sensors)

8 LEDs (displaying vehicle count)

Software:

Python script (sensor.py) for counting logic

Wokwi configuration files (diagram.json, main.py)

Functionality Increments count (+1 LED) when entry button is pressed

Decrements count (-1 LED) when exit button is pressed

Maintains count within 0-8 range

Visual feedback through LED display

Repository Contents Wokwi simulation files (.zip)

Python implementation (sensor.py)
